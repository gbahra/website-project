              <p>I am a recent Computer Science graduate at the University of Essex and achieved a 2:1 Hons degree. I am very articulate and have excellent communications skills both verbally, on the phone or in person, and written which makes me able to form strong business relationships. These skills enable to fully understand the needs of a client or team member so I can do everything I can to meet those needs. I learned these skills from my previous experience in customer service and retail. When working on any project small or large, I try to stay organised and prioritise my time and resources so I can handle large workloads, multitask and complete all work by the deadline. This is an important skill as managing my time well as me to use my strong attention to detail to ensure I miss nothing while still ensuring I keep to my deadlines even while under pressure. My programming experience has taught great problem-solving skills. I have the ability to solve complex problems with simple solutions as well as an understanding of technical concepts. I am a proactive individual who confident finding an answer for myself or asking questions. I am looking for a challenging environment where I can make a contribution.</p>
